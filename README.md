🏙️ Bengaluru Real Estate Market Intelligence Project

Mission 2: The Real Estate Takedown

This end-to-end data project demonstrates complete mastery of the data lifecycle — from data acquisition and cleaning to analytical querying and business intelligence visualization. The project focuses on the Bengaluru real estate market, delivering actionable insights through automation, SQL-driven analytics, and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

🎯 Objective

To prove capability in handling a full-scale data operation — from web scraping and transformation to database management, Excel-based client delivery, and Power BI visualization.

🚀 Project Workflow — 4 Phases
PHASE 1: PYTHON — The Acquisition & Forging

Goal: Scrape, clean, and store real estate data efficiently.

Process:

Used Requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape real estate listings from the target website.

Performed aggressive data cleaning using Pandas, NumPy, and Regex — including parsing prices, sizes, and converting unstructured text to structured data.

Calculated derived metrics such as price_per_sqft for deeper analysis.

Stored the cleaned dataset into an SQLite database (real_estate.db), forming the project’s single source of truth.

Output:
real_estate.db containing the fully cleaned and structured properties table.

PHASE 2: SQL — The Market Analysis

Goal: Extract critical market insights using SQL queries.

Analysis Performed:

Identified the Top 5 neighborhoods with the highest average Price_per_SqFt.

Compared average prices of 2 BHK vs. 3 BHK apartments in the most expensive neighborhood.

Counted total property listings per neighborhood to assess market density and trends.

Output:
Actionable insights and summary tables exported from SQL queries for use in visualization.

PHASE 3: EXCEL — The Client’s Request

Goal: Deliver a clean, filterable dataset for business clients.

Process:

Connected Microsoft Excel directly to real_estate.db via a SQL connection.

Executed the query:

SELECT * FROM properties 
WHERE Neighborhood = 'Whitefield' AND Bedrooms = 3;


Designed a professional, formatted Excel table that allows the client to easily sort, filter, and analyze listings of interest.

Output:
A client-ready Excel workbook with 3BHK property listings in Gachibowli.

PHASE 4: POWER BI — The Final Verdict

Goal: Present the complete market story through an interactive dashboard.

Key Features:

Data Source: Connected directly to real_estate.db.

DAX Measures: Created dynamic KPIs like Total Listings, Avg Price (Cr), and Avg Price per SqFt.

KPI Cards: For instant visibility into core metrics.

Interactive Map: Plots property locations with bubble size representing listing count.

Play Axis Animation: Visualizes changes in price vs. area across bedroom categories over time.

Custom Tooltips: Hovering reveals a detailed donut breakdown of property types by location.

Dark Theme: Professional “Onyx” theme for a sleek, modern aesthetic.

Output:
An advanced Power BI dashboard summarizing Bengaluru’s real estate market visually and interactively.
